PEP(Python Enhancement Proposal)-20 is the Zen of Python. Written by
long time Python developer Tim Peters, the Zen is acknowledged as the
core philosophy of Python. In fact, it is always accessible in any Python
environment by using import this: <!--more-->

Beautiful is better than ugly.<br/>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br/>
Simple is better than complex.<br/>
Complex is better than complicated.<br/>
Flat is better than nested.<br/>
Sparse is better than dense.<br/>
Readability counts.<br/>
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.<br/>
Although practicality beats purity.<br/>
Errors should never pass silently.<br/>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br/>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br/>
There should be one -and preferably only<br/>
one -obvious way to do it.<br/>
Although that way may not be obvious at first<br/>
unless you’re Dutch.<br/>
Now is better than never.<br/>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br/>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.<br/>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br/>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let’s do more of those!

## What is PEP?

Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's benevolent dictator for life.

## PEP-8 - the Python style guide
Python has its own style guide known as PEP8 that outlines various
guidelines that are good to follow. In fact, you must follow them if you plan
to contribute to Python Core. PEP 8 specifies such things as indentation
amount, maximum line length, docstrings, whitespace, naming
conventions, etc.
