User or Identity management in any most important and critical part of an application and any minor loophole can be exploited by Hacker.
And its big challenge and hassle for a developer to secure his and maintain the application. Stormpath provides an ecosystem for user management, authentication and authorization for your application. As their tagline says **"Never Build Auth Again"** that mean developer don't have to worry about build auth system and to secure and maintain. 

This post shows you how to use Stormpath Auth system with Spring Boot app. To get started we need put all the following dependency in our pom.xml<!--more-->

### POM.xml

</project>
```

### RestSecurityWebAppConfig.java 
This Adapter class main class where we are going to configure our secure route or URI. In below code, we configuring that all URL except `/` root has to go through the security check by stormpath.

```java
@Configuration
public class RestSecurityWebAppConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter{
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.apply(StormpathWebSecurityConfigurer.stormpath()).and()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/").permitAll();
    }
    
}
```

### IndexController.java

This rest controller or rest API free to use or we can say it a public API and user donÂ’t need to authenticated by stormpath.

```java
@RestController
public class IndexController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String index(){
        return "Hello World !";
    }
    
}
```

### SuperHeroController.java

This rest controller or rest API is secured by stormpath auth. Before getting output from this API user should be authenticated.

```java
@RestController
public class SuperHeroController {

    private String[][] data = {
                {"SpiderMan", "SuperMan", "BatMan", "Flash"},
                {"peter@mail.com", "clark@mail.com", "brue@mail.com","barry@mail.com"}
            };
    
    @RequestMapping("/superhero/{id}")
    public SuperHero getStudent(@PathVariable("id")int id){
        return new SuperHero(id, data[0][id], data[1][id]);
    }
    
}
```

### SpringStormOathApplication.java

This is SpringBootApplication class bootstrap our app and run it in an embedded tomcat.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringStormpathOauthApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringStormpathOauthApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

### application.properties

This properties file contain all the required properties to communicate with stormpath auth service. 

```properties
stormpath.application.href = https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/mFKrkiWGyI1t0Gpq638oo

stormpath.apiKey.id= 6LA4SVLABEN6RZS259KEVANR2
stormpath.apiKey.secret = L/ZtZUHrYWKDm6FP6/OCHAP6TdlmyvliT/77Ea+F+7s

stormpath.client.apiKey.id= 6LA4SVLABEN6RZS259KEVANR2
stormpath.client.apiKey.secret = L/ZtZUHrYWKDm6FP6/OCHAP6TdlmyvliT/77Ea+F+7s

```

The values of above properties will be diffrent in you case as you need to create an account at <a target="_blank" href="https://stormpath.com/">Stormpath</a>.

### Stormpath

First we need to create an account at <a target="_blank" href="https://stormpath.com/">Stormpath</a> after that you landup at following screen (dashboard).

![Dashboard Page at Stormpath.com](/assets/img/blog/Stormpath_Dashboard.PNG)

Then click on the Application Tab on that screen click on **Create Application** button then a form will appear to fill the required information and submit.

![Application tab at Stormpath.com](/assets/img/blog/stormpath_application.png)

After create our app you will get `stormpath.application.href` properties value. Now we need an account to access this app via `apiKey.id` and `apiKey.secret` as we make OAuth authentication for this app.

![Application Detials at Stormpath.com](/assets/img/blog/stormpath_app_href.png)

Now click on the account tabs you see there an account would already create that is an account you logged into stormpath.com. As you can see in below screenshot I have also created some other account to test as we going to use some of these accounts to login to our own app. But we will create `apiKey.id` and `apiKey.secret` from our stormpath login account in my case it is Digvijay Bhakuni it is also a Stormpath Admin account.

![Account tab at Stormpath.com](/assets/img/blog/stormpath_account.png)

Click on user account and scroll right to the bottom of screen under details you will find a button **Create API Key** as you click on that button a properties file will download to your system having you `apiKey.id` and `apiKey.secret` copy and paste the values to your `application.properties` file.

![User Account at Stormpath.com](/assets/img/blog/stormpath_user_account.png)

Now we are good to go navigate to project root in terminal then enter `mvn spring-boot:run`

> This account thing is similar what we have as Login Google. Suppose if we want add login via Google in our app then we need have a google developer account which provides an `apiKey.id` and `apiKey.secret`. This is basic concept of OAuth where "Internet users to authorise websites or applications to access their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords" therefore we don't need to manage user management stormpath will do it for us.

### Running App

Now open your browser and open the app you will be able to access root as it is not secure by stormpath and when navigate to `http://localhost:8080/superhero/1` and this is secure URL you will be redirected to login page.

You can login with any account you have created in stormpath dashboard or you will even find Sign Up button.

### Doing Rest OAuth

To doing login rest style if we create rest API then client is not going to use web UI to authenticate and consume you API therefore. I have done this with javascript client in the underlying screenshot.

![Javascript Oauth Client](/assets/img/blog/stormpath_ajax.PNG)

>This is the probable way you are going to use it in SPA (Single Page App).

Now you got the token in response JSON as access_token you can pass it under **Authorization** header like `bearer <token_value>` to access secure API.

### Decoding Token

With Stormpath we are using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) therefore we can decode it at *jwt.io*.
